<h3><span>EDMUND BURKE, AND THE "ANNUAL REGISTER."</span></h3>

<p>That Burke wrote the <i>Annual Registers</i> for Dodsley for some
period after its commencement is well known, but no one has yet
distinctly stated when his participation in that work ceased. Mr. Prior,
in his <i>Life of Burke</i>, places in his list of his writings: "<i>Annual
Register</i>, at first the whole work, afterwards only the Historical
Article, 1758," &amp;c. He also states that "many of the sketches of
contemporary history were written from his immediate dictation for about
thirty years," and that "latterly a Mr. Ireland wrote much of it under
Mr. Burke's immediate direction." (<i>Life</i>, vol. i. p. 85. edit. 1826.)</p>

<p>In proof of this statement, a fac-simile is given of Burke's receipts to
Dodsley for two sums of 50<i>l.</i> each "for the <i>Annual Register</i> of 1761,"
the originals of which were in Upcott's collection. At the sale of Mr.
Wilks's autographs this month, I observe there was another receipt for
writing the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1763. I am not aware whether any
other receipts from Burke are in existence for the money paid to him for
his contributions to this periodical, but for the <i>Annual Registers</i>
beginning with 1767, and terminating in 1791, I have the receipts of
Thomas English, who appears to have received from Dodsley, first
140<i>l.</i>, and subsequently 150<i>l.</i> annually, for writing and compiling
the historical portion of the work. Burke's connexion with the
publication must therefore have lasted a much shorter period than Mr.
Prior appears to have supposed, and apparently was not continued beyond
seven or eight years, from 1758 to 1766, after which year, English seems
to have taken his place.</p>

<p>Everything relating to Burke is of importance; and if any of your
correspondents can afford any further assistance in defining as
correctly as possible the limits of his participation in the <i>Annual
Register</i>, I feel assured that the information will be gladly received
by your readers.</p>

<p>I have not seen it noticed, that the historical articles in the <i>Annual
Registers</i>, from 1758 to 1762 inclusive, were collected in an 8vo. vol.
under the title of&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum">[442]</span>"A<a id="CHINA442"></a> compleat History of the late War, or Annual Register of
   its Rise, Progress, and Events in Europe, Asia, Africa, and
   America, &amp;c." London, 1763.</p>


<p class="noindent">This work went through more than one edition. My copy, containing 559
pages, is a Dublin edition of the date of 1763, printed by John Exshaw.</p>

<p>As there seems to be no question that what is contained in this volume
is the composition of Burke, and as it has never yet been superseded as
a spirited history of the stirring period to which it relates, it ought
undoubtedly to be attached as a supplement to the 8vo. edition of
Burke's <i>Works</i>, with his "Account of the European Settlements in
America," his title to which is now placed beyond dispute.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that some of Burke's early publications
are yet undiscovered, amongst which are his poetical translations from
the Latin, and his attack upon Henry Brooks, the author of the <i>Fool of
Quality</i>.</p>

<h3><span>JEWS IN CHINA.</span></h3>


<p class="blockquot">   The mail which arrived from East India and China about the middle
   or end of March last, brought news of the discovery of a race of
   Jews in the interior of the latter country, of which I have seen
   no notice taken by the English press.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  It being a subject in which a number of your readers will
   probably feel interested, and but comparatively few of them see
   the China newspapers, I beg to enclose you an account from the
   <i>Overland China Mail</i>, dated Hong Kong, Jan. 29, 1851.</p>


<p>The existence of a fragment of the family of Abraham in the interior of
China has been certainly known for upwards of two hundred years, and
surmised much longer. The Jesuit Ricci, during his residence at Peking
in the beginning of the seventeenth century, was the means of exciting
the attention of foreigners to the Jews of Kai-fung-fú, the ancient
capital of Ho-nan province. In 1618 they were visited by Aleni, a
follower of Ricci; and a hundred years later, between 1704 and 1723,
Fathers Gozani, Domenge, and Gaubil were enabled from personal
investigation on the spot to give minute descriptions of the people,
their synagogue and sacred books, the latter of which few could even
then read, while the former was, with the peculiar institutions of
Moses, fast falling to decay. Beyond a few feeble and ineffective
efforts on the part of Biblical critics, nothing was subsequently
attempted to maintain a communication with this handful of Jews until in
1815 some brethren in London addressed a letter to them in Hebrew, and
offered a large reward if any one would bring an answer in the same
language. The letter was entrusted to a Chinese bookseller, a native of
the province, who is reported to have delivered it, which was doubted,
as he brought no written answer.</p>

<p>Recently the Jews' Society in London, encouraged by the munificence of
Miss Cook, who placed ample funds at their disposal, instituted
enquiries on the subject, and sought the co-operation of the Bishop of
Victoria, who having previously opened a correspondence with Dr.
Medhurst on the subject, during his Lordship's recent visit to Shanghae,
the plan of operations was agreed upon. This was to despatch two Chinese
Christians, one of them a literary graduate, the other a young man with
a competent knowledge of English, acquired at the London Missionary
School. The <i>North China Herald</i> of the 18th January contains an
interesting account of their mission, from which we gather the following
particulars.</p>

<p>The two emissaries started on the 15th November last, and after an
absence of fifty-five days, returned to Shanghae, the distance between
the two cities being about six hundred <a id="miles1"></a>miles.<a href="#fn1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> Arrived at their
destination, they found in the decayed city of Kai-fung-fú, both
Mohamedans and Jews, the latter poverty-stricken and degraded, their
synagogue in a state of dilapidation, and the distinguishing symbols of
their religion nearly extinct. The books of the Law, written in a small
square character on sheepskin, are however still preserved, although it
would seem for many years they have been seen by no one able to read
them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#miles1" class="label">[1]</a> Kai-fung-fú, according to Williams's map, is situated about
a league from the southern bank of the Hwang-ho, or Yellow River, in 34° 55´ N. Lat., and 114° 40´ E. Long.</p>

<p>The Jesuits mention the existence of the sacred books, but were not
suffered to copy or even to inspect them; but the Chinese Christians
encountered no such scruples; so that, besides taking copies of
inscriptions on the stone tablets, they were enabled to bring away eight
Hebrew manuscripts, six of them containing portions of the Old
Testament, and two of the Hebrew liturgy. The correspondent of the
<i>North China Herald</i> states that&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "The portions of Scripture are from the 1st to the 6th chapters
   of Exodus, from the 38th to the 40th chapters of the same book,
   Leviticus 19th and 20th chapters, Numbers 13th, 14th, and 15th
   chapters, Deuteronomy from the 11th to the 16th chapters, with
   the 32nd chapter of that book. Various portions of the
   Pentateuch, Psalms, and Hagiographa occur in the books of
   prayers, which have not yet been definitely fixed. The character
   in which these portions are written is an antique form of the
   Hebrew, with <a id="points2"></a>points.<a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They are written on thick paper,
   evidently by means of a style, and the material employed, as well
   as the silk in which the books are bound, exhibit marks of a
   foreign origin. Two Israelitish gentlemen, to whom they have been
   shown in Shanghae, say that they have seen such books in Aden;
   and the occurrence here<a id="DUTCH443"></a> and <span class="pagenum">[443]</span>there of Persian words,
   written with Hebrew letters, in the notes appended, seem to
   indicate that the books in question came originally from the
   western part of Asia, perhaps Persia or Arabia. There is no trace
   whatever of the Chinese character about them, and they must have
   been manufactured entirely by foreigners residing in China, or
   who have come from a foreign country. Regarding their age, it
   would be difficult to hazard even a conjecture."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to
 text." href="#points2" class="label">[2]</a> The Jesuits state expressly that the Hebrew was without
points.</p>



<p>The result of this mission has been such that it cannot be doubted
another will be sent, and we trust the attempt at least will be made by
some discreet foreigner&mdash;a Jew, or at all events a Hebrew scholar&mdash;to
penetrate to Kai-fung-fú; for although the proofs brought away on the
present occasion are so far satisfactory, yet in the account given, on
the authority of the Chinese emissaries, we presume, there are several
things that might otherwise excite incredulity.</p>


<p class="right">S<span class="smcap lowercase">ALOPIAN</span>.</p>



<p class="blockquot">  [The <i>Jewish Intelligencer</i> for May, 1851, contains a long
   article on the "Present State of the Jews at Kai-fung-fú;" also a
   fac-simile of the Hebrew MS. found in the synagogue at that
   place, and a map of the eastern coast of China.]</p>



<h3><span>THE DUTCH MARTYROLOGY.</span></h3>

<p>Wall, in his <i>History of Infant Baptism</i>, frequently mentions a book
called <i>The Dutch Martyrology</i> as quoted by Danvers. He appears never to
have seen it, and if I mistake not (although I cannot just now find the
passage) he somewhere throws out a hint that no such book ever existed.
Archdeacon Cotton, in his valuable edition of Wall's book, says (vol.
ii. p. 131. note <i>m.</i>):</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Danvers cites this work as 'The Dutch Martyrology called <i>The
   bloody Theatre</i>; a most elaborate and worthy collection: written
   in Dutch, by M. J. Van Braght.' I have never seen it."</p>

<p>A very fine copy of this curious and very important work is in the Fagel
collection in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It is on large
paper, with the exception of some few leaves in different parts of the
volume, which have been mounted to match the rest. It is full of
beautiful engravings by Jan Luyken, representing the sufferings of the
martyrs; some of them, indeed all, possessing very great artistic merit.
The first in the volume, a crucifixion, representing Our Lord in the
very act of being nailed to the cross, is a most striking picture: and I
may also mention another, at p. 385., representing a party in a boat
reading the Bible, having put out to sea to escape observation.</p>

<p>The book is a large folio in 2 vols.: the first consisting of 450, the
second of 840 pages; and contains a most important collection of
original documents, which are indispensable to the history of the
Reformation, and many of them are intimately connected with the English
Reformation. The history of the martyrs begins with Our Saviour's
crucifixion (for He is represented as the first Anabaptist martyr!),
and ends with the year 1660. The Dublin copy is the second edition, and
its full title is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span>WITCHCRAFT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h3>

<p>Sir Roger Twysden, with all his learning, could not rise above the
credulity of his age; and was, to the last, as firm a believer in
palmistry and witchcraft, and all the illusions of magic, as the
generality of his cotemporaries. His commonplace-books furnish numerous
instances of the childlike simplicity with which he gave credence to any
tale of superstition for which the slightest shadow of authenticity
could be discovered.</p>

<p>The following amusing instance of this almost infantine credulity, I
have extracted from one of his note-books; merely premising that his
wife Isabella was daughter of Sir Nicholas Saunders, the narrator of the
tale:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "The 24th September, 1632, Sir Nicholas Saunders told me hee herd
   my lady of Arundall, widow of Phylip who dyed in y<span class="topnum">e</span> Tower
   1595, a virtuous and religious lady in her way, tell the ensuing
   relation of a Cat her Lord had. Her Lord's butler on a tyme, lost
   a cuppe or bowle of sylver, or at least of y<span class="topnum">t</span> prise he was
   much troubled for, and knowing no other way, he went to a wyzard
   or Conjurer to know what was become of it, who told him he could
   tell him where he might see the bowle if he durst take it. The
   servant sayd he would venture to take it if he could see it, bee
   it where it would. The wyzard then told hym in such a wood there
   was a bare place, where if he hyed himself for a tyme he
   appoynted, behind a tree late in the night he should see y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   Cuppe brought in, but w<span class="topnum">th</span> all advised him if he stept in to
   take it, he should make hast away w<span class="topnum">th</span> it as fast as myght bee.
   The servant observed what he was commanded by y<span class="topnum">e</span> Conjurer, and
   about Mydnyght he saw his Lord's Cat bring in the cup was myst,
   and divers other creatures bring in severall other things; hee
   stept in, went, and felt y<span class="topnum">e</span> Cuppe, and hyde home: where when
   he came he told his fellow servants this tale, so y<span class="topnum">t</span> at y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   last it was caryed to my Lord of Arundel's eare; who, when his
   Cat came to him, purring about his leggs as they used to doo,
   began jestingly to speake to her of it. The Cat presently upon
   his speech flewe in his face, at his throat, so y<span class="topnum">t</span> w<span class="topnum">th</span>out
   y<span class="topnum">e</span> help of company he had not escaped w<span class="topnum">th</span>out hurt, it was
   w<span class="topnum">th</span> such violence: and after my lord being rescued got away,
   unknown how, and never after seene.

<p><i>Witchcraft.</i> In the 13th year of the reign of King William the Third&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "One Hathaway, a most notorious rogue, feigned himself bewitched
   and deprived of his sight, and pretended to have fasted nine
   weeks together; and continuing, as he pretended, under this evil
   influence, he was advised, in order to discover the person
   supposed to have bewitched him, to boil his own water in a glass
   bottle till the bottle should break, and the first that came into
   the house after, should be the witch; and that if he scratched
   the body of that person till he fetched blood, it would cure him;
   which being done, and a poor old woman coming by chance into the
   house, she was seized on as the witch, and obliged to submit to
   be scratched till the blood came, whereupon the fellow pretended
   to find present ease. The poor woman hereupon was indicted for
   witchcraft, and tried and acquitted at Surrey assizes, before
   Holt, chief justice, a man of no great faith in these things; and
   the fellow persisting in his wicked contrivance, pretended still
   to be ill, and the poor woman, notwithstanding the acquittal,
   forced by the mob to suffer herself to be scratched by him. And
   this being discovered to be all imposition, an information was
   filed against him."&mdash;<i>Modern Reports</i>, vol. xii. p. 556.</p>

<h3><span>INDULGENCES PROPOSED TO BENEFACTORS TO THE CHURCH OF ST. GEORGE THE MARTYR, SOUTHWARK.</span></h3>

<p>As I believe little is known of the early history of this church, which
was dependent upon the Abbey and Convent of Bermondsey, the following
curious hand-bill or <i>affiche</i>, printed in black letter (which must have
been promulgated previous to the disgrace of Cardinal Wolsey, and the
suppression of religious houses in the reign of Henry VIII.), seems
worthy of preservation. It was part of<a id="GRAY445"></a> the <span class="pagenum">[445]</span>lining of an old cover
of a book, and thus escaped destruction. It is surmounted, at the left
hand corner, by a small woodcut representing St. George slaying the
dragon, and on the right, by a shield, which, with part of the margin,
has been cut away by the bookbinder. But few words are wanting, which
are supplied by conjecture in Italics.</p>

<p>It appears from Staveley's <i>History of Churches in England</i>, p. 99.,
that the monks were sent up and down the country, with briefs of a
similar character, to gather contributions of the people on these
occasions, and that the king's letter was sometimes obtained, in order
that they might prove more effectual.</p>

<p>It is most probable that the collectors were authorised to grant special
indulgences proportionate to the value of the contribution. No comment
is necessary upon these proceedings, from which at least the Reformation
relieved the people, and placed pious benefactions upon purer and better
motives.</p>

<h3><span>GRAY'S PLAGIARISMS. </span></h3>

<p>Your correspondent V<span class="smcap lowercase">ARRO</span> (Vol. iii., p. 206.) rejects as a plagiarism in
Gray the instance quoted by me from a note in Byron&nbsp;(Vol. iii., p. 35.),
on the ground that Gray has himself expressly stated that the passage
was "<i>an imitation</i>" of the one in Dante. I always thought that in
literature, as in other things, some thefts were acknowledged and others
unacknowledged, and that the only difference between them was, that,
while the acknowledgment went to extenuate the offence, it the more
completely established the fact of the appropriation. A great many
actual borrowings, but for such acknowledgment, might pass for
coincidences. "On peut se rencontrer," as the Chevalier Ramsay said on a
similar occasion.</p>

<p>The object, however, of this Note is not to shake V<span class="smcap lowercase">ARRO</span>'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> belief in the
impeccability of Gray, for whose genius I entertain the highest
admiration and respect, but to show your readers that the imputation of
plagiarism against that poet is not wholly unfounded. First, we have the
well-known line in his poem of <i>The Bard</i>,&mdash;</p>


   <div class="poem"> <p> "Give ample room and verge enough,"&mdash;</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">which is shown to have been appropriated from the following passage in
Dryden's tragedy of <i>Don Sebastian</i>:</p>


  <div class="poem"> <p> "Let fortune empty her whole quiver on me;</p>
  <p>    I have a soul that, like an <i>ample</i> shield,</p>
  <p> Can take in all, and <i>verge enough</i> for more."</p>
</div>


<p>To this I shall add the famous apothegm at the close of the following
stanzas, in his Ode <i>On a Prospect of Eton College</i>:</p>


  <div class="poem"><p> "Yet, ah! why should they <i>know</i> their fate,</p>
      <p>Since <i>sorrow</i> never comes too late,</p>
      <p>And happiness too swiftly flies;</p>
      <p>... ... <i>Where ignorance is bliss,</i></p>
      <p><i>'Tis folly to be wise</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>The same thought is expressed by Sir W. Davenant in the lines:</p>

     <div class="poem"><p> "Then ask not bodies doom'd to die</p>
     <p class="i3">To what abode they go:</p>
     <p> Since knowledge is but sorrow's spy,</p>
     <p class="i3"> 'Tis better not to know."</p>
</div>

<p>But the source of Gray's apothegm is still more obviously traceable to
these lines in Prior:</p>

     <div class="poem"><p> "Seeing aright we see our woes;</p>
        <p class="i3">Then what avails us to have eyes?</p>
     <p> <i>From ignorance our comfort flows,</i></p>
       <p class="i3"> <i>The only wretched are the wise.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>A third sample in Gray is borrowed from Milton. The latter, in speaking
of the Deity, has this beautiful image:</p>


<div class="poem">    <p>  "<i>Dark with excessive light</i> thy skirts appear."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum">[446]</span>And Gray, with<a id="APPLICATION446"></a> true poetic feeling, has applied this image to
Milton himself in those forceful lines in the <i>Progress of Poesy</i>, in
which he alludes to the poet's blindness:</p>

  <div class="poem"> <p> "The living throne, the sapphire blaze,</p>
    <p>Where angels tremble while they gaze,</p>
    <p>  He saw; but, <i>blasted with excess of light</i>,</p>
    <p>Closed his eyes in endless night."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is a passage in Longinus which appears to me to have furnished
Milton with the germ of this thought. The Greek rhetorician is
commenting on the use of figurative language, and, after illustrating
his views by a quotation from Demosthenes, he adds: "In what has the
orator here <i>concealed</i> the figure? plainly <i>in its own lustre</i>." In
this passage Longinus elucidates one figure by another,&mdash;a not unusual
practice with that elegant writer.</p>

<h3><span>ON THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD "LITTUS" IN THE SENSE OF RIPA, THE BANK OF A RIVER.</span></h3>

<p>The late Marquis Wellesley, towards the close of his long and glorious
life, wrote the beautiful copy of Latin verses upon the theme "Salix
Babylonica," which is printed among his <i>Reliquiæ</i>.</p>

<p>In this copy of verses is to be found the line,&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><p>  "At tu, pulchra Salix, Thamesini <i>littoris</i> hospes."</p>
</div>


<p>Certain critics object to this word "littoris," used here in the sense
of "ripa." The question is, whether such an application can be borne out
by ancient authorities. To be sure, the substitution of "marginis" for
"littoris" would obviate all controversy; but as the objection has been
started, and urged with some pertinacity, it may be worth while to
consider it. The ordinary meaning of <i>littus</i> is undoubtedly the
sea-shore; but it seems quite certain that it is used occasionally in
the sense of "ripa."</p>

<p>In the 2d Ode of Horace, book 1st, we find:</p>

      <div class="poem"><p> "Vidimus flavum Tiberim, retortis</p>
      <p><i>Littore</i> Etrusco violenter undis,</p>
      <p>Ire dejectum monumenta regis,</p>
      <p class="i7"> Templaque Vestæ;</p>
      <p>Iliæ dum se nimium querenti</p>
      <p>Jactat ultorem; vagus et sinistrâ</p>
      <p>Labitur <i>ripâ</i>."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;meaning, as I conceive, that the waters of the Tiber were thrown back
from the Etruscan <i>shore</i>, or <i>right bank</i>, which was the steep side, so
as to flood the left bank, and do all the mischief. If this
interpretation be correct, which Gesner supports by the following note,
the question is settled by this single passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Quod fere malim propter ea quæ sequuntur, <i>littus ipsius
   Tiberis</i> dextrum, quod spectat Etruriam: unde <i>retortis undis
   sinistrâ ripâ</i> Romam alluente, <i>labitur</i>."</p>


<p>Thus, at all events, I have the authority of Gesner's scholarship for
"<i>littus ipsius Tiberis</i>."</p>

<p>There are two other passages in Horace's <i>Odes</i> where "littus" seems to
bear a different sense from the sea-shore. The first, book iii. ode&nbsp;4.:</p>

    <div class="poem"> <p> "Insanientem <i>navita</i> Bosporum</p>
        <p class="i3">Tentabo, et arentes arenas</p>
       <p class="i5">Littoris Assyrii <i>viator</i>."</p></div>


<p class="noindent">The next, book iii. ode&nbsp;17.:</p>


     <div class="poem"><p> "Qui Formiarum m&oelig;nia dicitur</p>
 <p class="i3"> Princeps, et innantem Maricæ</p>
     <p class="i5">Littoribus tenuisse Lirim."</p></div>


<p class="noindent">Upon which latter Gesner says, that as Marica was a nymph from whom the
river received its name,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Hinc <i>patet</i> Lirim atque Maricam fuisse <i>duo unius fluminis
   nomina</i>."</p>

<p class="noindent">But I will not insist upon these examples even with the support of
Gesner, because Marica <i>may</i> have been a district situate on the
sea-shore, and because, in the former passage, "littus Assyrium" <i>may</i>
mean the <i>Syrian</i> coast, which is washed by the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>But to go to another author, in book x. of Lucan's <i>Pharsalia</i> will be
found (line 244.):</p>


<div class="poem"><p>  "Vel quod aquas toties rumpentis <i>littora</i> Nili</p>
<p>  <a id="Assidu3"></a>Assiduè<a class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3">[3]</a> feriunt, coguntque resistere flatus."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This seems to be a clear case of the Nile breaking its banks, and is
conclusive. Again, in book viii. l. 641.:</p>


<div class="poem"><p> "Et prior in <i>Nili</i> pervenit <i>littora</i> Cæsar."</p>
</div>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a class="label" title="Return to text." href="#Assidu3">[3]</a> Sc. Zephyri.</p>

<p>And again, "littore Niliaco," book ix. l. 135.</p>

<p>Lastly, in Scheller's <i>Dictionary</i>, the same meaning is given from the
8th book of Virgil's <i>Æneid</i>:</p>


<div class="poem"><p> "<i>Viridique in littore</i> conspicitur sus;"</p></div>


<p class="noindent">where, beyond a doubt, is meant "littore" <i>fluviali</i>.</p>

<p>It appears, then, from these examples that Lord Wellesley is justified
in his application <a id="Minor_Notes446"></a>of the word "littus" to the adjective "Thamesinus."</p>

<h3><span>THE WINDOW-TAX, LOCAL MINTS, AND NOBBS OF NORWICH.</span></h3>

<p>In a MS. chronicle, now before me, of remarkable events which occurred,
in connexion with the history of the city of Norwich, from the earliest
period to the year 1716, compiled by an inhabitant of the place named
Nobbs, of whom a word or two at the end of this note, occurs the
following passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "This year (1695) the parliament made an act for remedying the
   coin of the nation, which was generally debased by counterfeits,
   and diminished by clipping, and <i>laid a tax upon glass windows</i>,
   to make good the deficiency when it should be taken in. And, for
   the speedy supply of money to the subjects, upon calling in of
   the old money, there were mints set up in York, Bristol, Chester,
   Exeter, and Norwich. The mint in Norwich began to work in Sept.
   1696. Coined there 259,371<i>l.</i> The amount of plate and coin
   brought into this mint was 17,709 ounces."</p>

<p>These quantities are identical with those given by Blomefield (<i>History
of Norwich</i>, fol., 1741, p. 300.).</p>

<p>1. The duties chargeable on windows, as now collected, were <i>regulated</i>
by Sched. A. of 48 Geo. III. c. 55.; but, assuming the correctness of
Nobbs' statement, is it generally known that this tax <i>originated</i> in
the year, and under the circumstances, above recorded?</p>

<p>Bishop Burnet (<i>Hist. Own Time</i>, 8vo., 1833, vol. iv. pp. 252. 258.),
describing the proceedings taken by parliament for rectifying the state
of the coinage, without telling us by what means the money was raised,
says (p. 290.):</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "Twelve thousand pounds was given to supply the deficiency of the
   bad and clipped money."</p>


<p>Is this sum the amount of the proceeds of the tax laid, as our chronicle
records, upon glass windows? If so, or from whatever source obtained, it
may, in passing, be remarked, that it appears to be ridiculously
inadequate to meet the requirements of the case; for, according to the
Bishop, in another place (p. 316.):</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "About five millions of clipped money was brought into the
   exchequer, and the loss that the nation suffered, by the
   recoining of the money, amounted to two millions and two hundred
   thousand pounds."</p>

<p>The window duties have of late provoked much discussion, and it would
prove of some interest, if, through the medium of your pages, any of
your correspondents would take the trouble to investigate a little
further the subject of this note. It very easily admits of confirmation
or denial.</p>

<p>2. The principal reason, however, for now writing, is to request answers
to the two following Queries: 1. What amount of money was respectively
coined during 1696, and the following year, in the cities of York,
Bristol, Chester, and Exeter? <span class="pagenum">[448]</span>and 2. <a id="In448"></a>In what parish of each of
these places, including Norwich, was the mint situated?</p>

<p>And now let me add a sentence or two respecting the compiler of the
above-named chronicle, which I am induced to do, as his name is closely
connected with that of one of the most celebrated controversial writers
of the Augustan age of Anne and George I., the friend of Whiston, of
Newton, and of Hoadley, and the subject of Pope's sarcastic allusion:</p>

    <div class="poem"><p>"We nobly take the high priori road,</p>
     <p> And reason downwards till we doubt of God."</p></div>


<p>It appears, on the authority of a MS. letter before me, dated Aylsham,
Norfolk, Jan. 25, 1755, and addressed to Mr. Nehemiah Lodge, town clerk
of Norwich, by Mr. Thos. Johnson, who was speaker of the common council
of that city from 1731 to 1736, that Nobbs</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Was many years clerk of St. Gregory's parish in Norwich, where
   he kept a school, and was so good a scholar as to fit youths for
   the university, amongst whom were the great Dr. Samuel Clarke,
   and his brother, the Dean of Salisbury."</p>


<p>The old man's MS. is very neatly written, and arranged with much method.
It was made great use of, frequently without acknowledgment, by
Blomefield, in the compilation of his history; and besides the chronicle
of events immediately connected with the city, there are interspersed
through its pages notices of earthquakes, great famines, blazing stars,
dry summers, long frosts, and other similar unusual occurrences. The
simplicity, and grave unhesitating credulity, with which some of the
more astonishing marvels, culled, I suppose, from the pages "of
Holinshed or Stow," are recorded, is very amusing. I cannot refrain from
offering you a couple of examples, and with them I will bring this
heterogeneous "note" to a close.</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "In the eighth year of this king's reign (E. II.) it was ordained
   by parliament, that an ox fatted with grass should be sold for
   15<i>s.</i>, fatted with corn 20<i>s.</i>, the best cow for 12<i>s.</i>; a fat
   hog of two years 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; a fat sheep shorn 14<i>d.</i>, and with
   fleece 20<i>d.</i>; a fat capon 2<i>d.</i>, a fat hen 1<i>d.</i>, four pigeons
   1<i>d.</i> And whosoever sold for more, should forfeit his ware to the
   king. But this order was soon revoked, by reason of the scarcity
   that after followed. For, in the year following, 1315, there was
   so great a dearth, that continued three years, and therewith a
   mortality, that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead;
   horses, dogs, and children were eaten in that famine, and thieves
   in prison plucked in pieces those that were newly brought in, and
   eat them half alive."
</p>

<p>But, again, sub ann. 1349:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "This year dyed in Norwich of the plague, from the first of
   January to the last of June, 57,374 persons, besides religious
   people and beggars; and in Yarmouth, 7053. This plague began
   November the first, 1348, and continued to 1357, and it hath been
   observed that they that were born after this had but twenty-eight
   teeth, whereas before they had thirty-two."
</p>


<p>This latter notice refers to the first of those three destructive
epidemics which visited Europe during the reign of our Edw. III., and
are so frequently mentioned in ancient records. It is styled the
"Pestilencia Prima et Magna, Anno Domini 1349, a festo Stæ. Petronillæ
usque ad <a id="Minor_Queries448"></a>festum Sti. Michaelis." (Nicolas, <i>Chron. of Hist.</i>, p. 345.)</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span></h3>


<h4><span><i>Gillingham.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can you, or any of your correspondents, furnish me with
any historical or local data that may tend to identify the place where
that memorable council was convened, by which the succession to the
English crown was transferred from the Danish to the Saxon line?
Hutchins, in his <i>History of Dorset</i> (Edw. II., 1813, vol. iii. p.
196.), says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "<a id="Malmsbury4"></a>Malmsbury<a class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4">[4]</a> mentions a council held at Gillingham, in which
   Edward the Confessor was chosen king. It was really a grand
   council of the realm; but the generality of our historians place
   it with more probability at London, or in the environs thereof."
</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a class="label" title="Return to text." href="#Malmsbury4">[4]</a> Book ii. c. 12. p. 45.</p>

<p>I am not aware of anything else that can be advanced in support of the
claims of the Dorset shire Gillingham to be the scene of this event
except it be the fact that a royal palace or hunting-seat there was the
occasional residence of the English kings early in the twelfth century,
and subsequently. I do not know whether its existence can be traced
prior to the Conquest; and unless that can be done, it is obviously of
no importance in the present inquiry. Now it had occurred to me that,
after all, Gillingham, near Chatham in <i>Kent</i>, may be the true locality;
but, unfortunately, my knowledge of that place is limited to the fact,
that our London letters, when directed without the addition of "Dorset,"
are usually sent to rusticate there for a day or two. Perhaps one of
your Kentish correspondents will favour me with some more pertinent
information. </p>

<p>&mdash;"You have made a regular <i>mull</i>

from my school days even to the present time. Can you give me the origin
of it? In reading a very clever and interesting paper communicated by J.
M. Kemble, Esq., to the Archæological Institute of Great Britain and
Ireland in the volume of their proceedings for 1845, entitled, "The
Names, Surnames, and Nicnames of the Anglo-Saxons," I found the
following paragraph:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Two among the early kings of Wessex are worthy of peculiar
   attention, viz., the celebrated sons of Cênberht, Cædwealha and
   his brother Mûl. Of the former it is known, that after a short
   and brilliant career of victory, he voluntarily relinquished the
   power he had won, became a convert to Christianity, and having
   retired to Rome, was there baptised by the name Petrus, and died
   while yet in the Albs, a few days after the ceremony. His brother
   Mûl, during their wars in Kent, suffered himself to be surprised
   by the country-people and was burnt to death, together with twelve
   comrades, in a house where they had taken refuge."</p>

bounding peas on the hot plate. Is any solution to be given? The writer
has heard that the practice originated in the loss of a ship (freighted
with peas) on the coast of Northumberland. Carling is the foundation

Leicestershire, there are effigies of his children sculptured. Two of
the sons are represented in a kneeling posture, with their hands clasped
and upraised; while all the others are standing, some cased in armour,
or otherwise. Can you, from knowledge of heraldry, or any other source,

What is the derivation of it? It means, I believe, a young heron.
Chaucer ("Squire's Tale," l. 90.) spells it "heronsewe." As <i>sewe</i>
signifies a dish (whence the word <i>sewer</i>, he who serves up the dinner),
this word applied to <i>heron</i> may mean one fit for eating, young and
tender.</p>

<h4><span >"<i>Trepidation talk'd</i>."</span></h4>

</div>

<p>By the last three words we may easily understand the <i>primum mobile</i> of
the Ptolemaic astronomy; and <i>trepidation</i> is thus explained in the
<i>Imperial Dictionary</i>:</p>


<p class="blockquot">    "In the <i>old astr.</i> a libration of the eighth sphere, or a motion
   which the Ptolemaic system ascribes to the firmament, to account
   for the changes and motion of the axis of the world."</p>


<p>Newton, in his edition of Milton, is silent. Bentley says in a note:</p>


<p class="blockquot">    "<i>Foolish</i> ostentation, in a thing that a child may be taught in
   a map of these imaginary spheres. <i>Talk'd</i>, not good English, for
   called, styled, named."</p>


<p>Paterson, in his <i>Commentary on Paradise Lost</i>, 1744, for the sight of
which I am indebted to the courtesy of the librarian of the Chetham
Library, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "<i>Trepidation</i>, Lat., an astronomical T., a trembling, a passing.
   Here, two imagined motions of those spheres. Therefore Milton
   justly ridicules those wild notions."</p>

<h3><span>THE OUTER TEMPLE. <br />
(Vol. iii., p. 375.)</span></h3>
<p class="center"></p>


<p>While I thank M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ETER</span>
 C<span class="smcap lowercase">UNNINGHAM</span> for his ready compliance with my
request, I am sorry to say that I cannot concur in the reliance which he
expresses on the authority of Sir George Buc. The passage quoted from
that writer contains so palpable a blunder in that part of the history
of the Temple of which we have authentic records, that I look with much
suspicion on that portion of the relation, with regard to which no
documentary evidence has been found.</p>

<p>He makes "Hugh Spencer, Earle of Glocester," the next successor of the
Earl of Lancaster in the possession of the Temple after the suppression,
and places "Andomare de Valence" in the house <i>after</i> the execution of
Spencer for treason: an account which receives a somewhat significant
contradiction in the fact, that Valence died in 1323, and Spencer was
beheaded in 1326.</p>

<p>With reference to Buc's assertion, that "the other third part, called
the Outward Temple, Doctor Stapleton, Bishop of Exceter, had gotten in
the raign of the former king, Edward the Second, and conuerted it to a
house for him and his successors, Bishops of Exceter," I can only say
that no such grant has ever been discovered, and that every fact on
which we have any information in relation to the Templars' possessions
in London, contradicts the presumption that any part of them was
disposed of to the bishop. He was raised to his see in 1307. The
Templars were suppressed in 1309. Their lands and tenements in London
were then placed in the hands of custodes appointed by the king, who in
1311 transferred them into the custody of the sheriffs of London, with
directions to account for the rents into the Exchequer. In both of these
documents, and in the grants to the Earls of Lancaster and Pembroke, A<span class="smcap lowercase">LL</span>
the property that belonged to the Templars in London and its suburbs is
expressly included; without excepting any part of it as having been
previously granted to the bishop; which, had any such been made, would
inevitably have been specially noticed. And I have already shown in my
former communication (p. 325.) that the grant by the Hospitallers
themselves to Hugh le Despenser in 1324 is of the <i>whole</i> of their house
called the New Temple, and that the bishop's mansion is therein stated
to be its western boundary.</p>

<p>All these particulars confirm me in my opinion, that the bishop's house
never formed any <a id="BELLMAN451"></a>part of the New Temple.</p>

<h3><span>THE OLD LONDON BELLMAN AND HIS SONGS OR CRIES. <br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 324. 377.)</span></h3>
<p class="center"></p>

<p>The songs of the old bellman are interesting relics of the manners and
customs of "London in the olden time;" but they must not be confounded
with the more modern "copies of verses" which, until lately, were
annually handed about at Christmas time by that all-important
functionary the "Parish Beadle." The history of the old London bellman
may be gleaned from a series of tracts from the pen of those two
prolific writers&mdash;Thomas Dekker and Samuel Rowlands. The first of these
in the order of date is <i>The Belman of London. Bringing to light the
most notorious Villanies that are now practised in the Kingdome.
Profitable for Gentlemen, Lawyers, Merchants, Citizens, <a id="Farmers452"></a>Farmers,
<span class="pagenum">[452]</span> Masters of Households, and all sortes of Servants to marke, and
delightfull for all Men to Reade.</i> Printed at London for Nathaniel
Butler, 4to. 1608. The author of this tract was Thomas Dekker. Its
popularity was so great that it passed through <i>three</i> editions in the
course of one year. The title-page above given is that of the first
impression. It is adorned with an interesting woodcut of the bellman
with bell, lantern, and halberd, followed by his dog. In the following
year the same author printed his <i>Lanthorne and Candle-light, or the
Bellman's second Nights-walke. In which he brings to light a Brood of
more strange Villanies then ever were till this yeare discovered, &amp;c.</i>
London, printed for John Busbie, 4to. 1609. The success of the <i>Bellman
of London</i>, which Dekker published anonymously, induced him to write
this second part, to the dedication of which "to Maister Francis Mustian
of Peckham" he puts his name, while he also admits the authorship of the
first part. This is the second edition of <i>Lanthorne and Candle-light</i>,
but it came out originally in the same year. On the title-page of this
tract the bellman is represented in a night-cap, without his dog, and
with a "brown bill" on his shoulder. Three years later Dekker produced
his <i>O per se O, or a New Cryer of Lanthorne and Candle-light. Being an
Addition, or Lengthening of the Bellman's Second Night-walke, &amp;c.</i>
Printed at London for John Busbie, 4to. 1612. Previous to the year 1648,
this production went through no fewer than <i>nine</i> distinct editions,
varying only in a slight degree from each other. One of these editions,
now before me, has for its title <i>English Villanies Eight severall times
Prest to Death by the Printers</i>, 4to. 1648. The author in this calls the
bellman "the childe of darkeness, a common night-walker, a man that hath
no man to wait upon him, but onely a dogge; one that was a disordered
person, and at midnight would beat at men's doores bidding them (in
meere mockerie) to looke to their candles, when they themselves were in
their dead sleepes." The following verses are at the back of the
title-page, preceded by a woodcut of a bellman. The same lines are also
given, "with additions," in the earlier editions of the <i>Villanies</i>, but
they are too indecent to quote:</p>


     <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"> <p class="i3">"THE BELL-MAN'S CRY.</p></div>

      <div class="stanza"> <p> "Men and children, maids and wives,</p>
       <p>'Tis not too late to mend your lives:</p>
       <p> Midnight feastings are great wasters,</p>
       <p> Servants' riots undoe masters.</p>
       <p> When you heare this ringing bell,</p>
       <p> Thinke it is your latest knell:</p>
       <p> Foure a clock, the cock is crowing,</p>
       <p> I must to my home be going:</p>
       <p> When all other men doe rise,</p>
       <p> Then must I shut up mine eyes."</p></div>
</div>


<p>The exceeding popularity of the <i>Bellman of London</i> induced Samuel
Rowlands to bring out his <i>Martin Mark-all, Beadle of Bridewell, his
Defence and Answere to the Belman of London, discovering the
long-concealed Originall and Regiment of Rogues when they first began to
take head, and how they have succeeded, &amp;c.</i> Printed for John Budge,
&amp;c., 4to. 1610. The object of this publication was to expose Dekker's
<i>Bellman</i>, which Rowlands says was only a "vamp up" of Harman's <i>Caveat
or Warening for Common Cursetors</i>; but Harman himself was only a
borrower, and the origin of his work is <i>The Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i>,
printed prior to 1565. Greene's <i>Ground-work of Coney-catching</i> is
another work which may be pointed out as having been taken from the same
original. But as these tracts do not contain any "bellman's songs," I
need not now dwell upon them.</p>

<p>Among the many curious musical works printed in London at the close of
the sixteenth and the beginning of the following century, I can scarcely
point out a more desirable volume than one with this title: <i>Melismata,
Musical Phansies fitting the Court, City, and Country Humours, to three,
four, and five voices</i>:</p>

     <div class="poem"><p> <i>To all delightful, except to the spiteful;</i></p>
      <p><i>To none offensive, except to the pensive.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">London, printed by William Stansby, &amp;c., 4to. 1611. The work is in five
divisions, viz., 1. Court Varieties; 2. Citie Rounds; 3. Citie Conceits;
4. Country Rounds; 5. Country Pastimes. Among the "City Conceits" we
have the following:</p>


     <div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><p class="i3">"A BEL-MAN'S SONG.</p></div>
    <div class="stanza"> <p> "Maides to bed, and cover coale,</p>
     <p> Let the mouse out of her hole;</p>
     <p>  Crickets in the chimney sing,</p>
     <p> Whilst the little bell doth ring:</p>
     <p> If fast asleepe, who can tell</p>
     <p>  When the clapper hits the bell."</p></div>
</div>

<p>But perhaps the most curious collection of bellman's songs that has been
handed down to us, is a small tract of twelve leaves entitled <i>The
Common Calls, Cries, and Sounds of the Bel-Man; or Diverse Verses to put
us in minde of our Mortality</i>, 12mo. Printed at London, 1639. This
excessively rare and interesting "set of rhymes" is now before me, and
from them I have extracted a few specimens of the <i>genuine</i> old songs of
the London bellman of past times:&mdash;</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The collection of Bellman's songs here described is sometimes found
appended to a little work entitled <i>Time well Improved, or Some Helps
for Weak Heads in their Meditations</i>, 12mo. 1657. The latter publication
is a reprint, with a new title-page, of Samuel Rowlands' <i>Heaven's
Glory, seeke it; Earth's Vanitie, fly it; Hell's Horror, fere it</i>. But
whether the songs in question were written, or merely collected by
Rowlands, does not appear.</p>

<h3><span>THE TRAVELS OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, AND THE AUTHOR OF THE SABBATH.<br />
 (Vol. iii., p. 305.)</span></h3>
<p class="center"></p>

<p>1. In answer to the communication of A C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLECTOR</span>, allow me to remark,
that although Bruce did not publish his <i>Travels</i> till about seventeen
years after his return to Great Britain, various details had got abroad;
and, as usually happens, the actual facts, as given by himself, were
either intentionally or accidentally misrepresented. Latterly, Bruce,
indignant at the persecution he suffered, held his tongue, and patiently
awaited the publication of his <i>Travels</i> to silence his accusers.
Amongst other teasing occurrences, Paul Jodrell brought him on the stage
in a clever after-piece which was acted in the Haymarket in 1779, and
was published in 8vo. in 1780. A copy of this piece, which is called <i>A
Widow and no Widow</i>, is now before me: and Macfable, a Scotch travelling
impostor, was acted by Bannister; and the hits at Bruce cannot be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Further, Bruce himself understood that he was the party meant by
"Munchausen," and he complained of this and many other attacks to a
distant relative of mine, who died a few years since, and who mentioned
the circumstances to me; adding, that Bruce uniformly declared that the
publication of his work would, he had no doubt, afford a triumphant
answer to his calumniators.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of Munchausen, I may observe, that the story of
the frozen words is to be found in <i>Nugæ venales, or a Complaisant
Companion</i>, by Head, the author or compiler of the <i>English Rogue</i>. It
occurs among the lies, p. 133.:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "A soldier swore desperately that being in the wars between the
   Russians and Polemen, there chanced to be a parley between the
   two generals where a river parted them. At that time it froze so
   excessive that the words were no sooner out of their mouths but
   they were frozen, and could not be heard till <i>eleven</i> days
   after, that a thaw came, when the dissolved words themselves made
   them audible to all."
</p>

<p>As my copy has a MS. title, I should be obliged if any of your readers
could furnish me with a correct one.</p>

<p>2. There were <i>not</i> "two James Grahame" cotemporaries. The author of
<i>Wallace</i> was the author of <i>The Sabbath</i>, as well as of <i>Poems and
Tales, Scotch and English</i>, thin 8vo., Paisley, 1794: a copy of which,
as well as of <i>Mary Stewart</i> and <i>Wallace</i>, is in my tolerably extensive
dramatic library. The latter is defective, ending at p. 88.; and was
saved some years ago from a lot of the drama about to be consigned to
the snuff-shop. Probably the same reasons which caused the suppression
of a political romance from the same pen, and of which I have reason to
believe the only existing copy is in my library, may have induced the
non-completion of <i>Wallace</i>. Grahame, like many other young men just
emerging at that particular time from the Scotch Universities, had
imbibed opinions which in after years his good sense repudiated. He
concealed his authorship of the Paisley poems (now very scarce), and the
secret only transpired after his death. From the intimacy that subsisted
between myself and his amiable nephew and namesake, whose untimely
death, in 1817, at the age of twenty, I have never ceased to lament, I
had the best means of learning many facts relative to the poet, who was,
according to all accounts, one of the most estimable and truly pious men
that ever lived. As to the crude opinions of early <a id="youth454"></a>youth, <span class="pagenum">[454]</span>can we
forget that the truly admirable Southey was the author of <i>Wat Tyler</i>?</p>

<p>Whether there were only six copies of <i>Wallace</i> <i>completed</i>, I cannot say;
but this much I can assert, that there were a great many printed, and
that, as before mentioned, the greater part went to the snuff-shop;
probably, because people were not fond of purchasing a drama wanting the
title and end.</p>

<p>In concluding, I may mention, that the "Mary Stewart" in the 12mo.
edition of the <i>Poems of Grahame</i>, is quite altered from the one printed
in 8vo. in<a id="PENN454"></a> 1801.</p>

<h3><span>THE PENN FAMILY. <br />
(Vol. iii., p. 409.)</span></h3>


<p>In reply to your correspondent A. N. C., William Penn, eldest son of the
famous Quaker, married Mary Jones, by whom he had three children,
Gulielma Maria, Springett, and William. The latter had a daughter by his
first wife, Miss Fowler, who married a Gaskill, from which marriage the
present Penn Gaskills of Rolfe's Hould, Buckinghamshire, are descended.
While writing on this subject, allow me to send you two other "notes."</p>

<p>Hugh David, a Welshman, who went out to America in the same vessel with
William Penn, used to relate this curious anecdote of the state founder.
Penn, he says, after watching a goat gnaw at a broom which lay on deck,
called out to him, "Hugh, dost thou observe the goat? See what hardy
fellows the Welsh are; how they can feed on a broom! However, Hugh, I am
a Welshman myself, and will relate by how strange a circumstance our
family lost their name. My grandfather was named John Tudor, and lived
on the top of a hill or mountain in Wales. He was generally called John
Penmunith, which in English is&mdash;<i>John on the top of the hill</i>. He
removed from Wales into Ireland, where he acquired considerable
property. Upon his return to his own country he was addressed by his
friends and neighbours, not in the former way, but as Mr. Penn. He
afterwards removed to London, where he continued to reside under the
name of John Penn, which has since been the family name." David told
this story to a Quaker, who wrote it down in these words, and gave the
MS. to Robert Proud, the historian of Pennsylvania. The same David, in a
copy of doggrel verses presented to Thomas Penn on a visit to
Philadelphia in 1732, made an allusion to this descent. I quote four of
the lines:</p>

    <div class="poem"><p>"For the love of him that now descended be,</p>
    <p> I salute his loyal one of three,</p>
    <p> That ruleth here in glory so serene,</p>
    <p> I branch of Tudor, alias Thomas Penn."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This is at least curious. But I attach little credit to Mr. David's
report. He certainly mistook or ill remembered Penn's words; as his
grandfather was Giles Penn, and his ancestors for two generations
before Giles are known to have been William.</p>

<p>The second note refers to Penn's descendants, and may claim a corner in
your chronicle on more than one ground. William Penn was born in 1644:
in 1844 his grandson, Granville Penn, well known as a writer on
classical subjects, was still alive! The descendants of his first
marriage with Miss Springett, six years ago were in the fifth and sixth
generation after him;<a id="WORD454"></a> those by his second wife, Hannah Callowhill, in
the second.</p>

<h3><span>ON THE WORD "PRENZIE" IN "MEASURE FOR MEASURE." <br />
(Vol. iii., p. 401.)</span></h3>


<p>I have read with attention the argument of your correspondent L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span> on
the passage in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, in which the word "prenzie"
occurs; and to much that he advances I should, like the modest orator
who followed Mr. Burke, be contented to say "ditto." Nevertheless, as I
cannot agree with him altogether, I beg permission to make a few remarks
upon the question. The extent of my agreement with your correspondent
will be shown in stating, that I think neither "priestly," "princely,"
nor "precise" to be the true word. We disagree, however, in the measure
of our dislike; for of the three suggested corrections, "princely" is,
to my mind, by far the best, and "precise," beyond all measure, the
worst. Indeed, but that Mr. Knight has adopted the latter term, as well
as Tieck, I should have regarded it as an instance of the difficulty in
the way of the best qualified Germans of understanding the niceties of
English meaning, or of feeling how far license might be tolerated in
English versification. In adopting this term Mr. Knight appears to have
forgotten that it has a special application as the Duke (Act I. Sc. 4.)
uses it. Taken in connexion with the expressions "stands at a guard" and
"scarce confesses," <i>cautiously exact</i> would appear to express the sense
in a passage the whole spirit of which shows a scarcely disguised
suspicion. The Duke, evidently, would not have been surprised, as
Claudio was; and the expression appropriate to a close observer like the
one, is a most unlikely epithet to have been chosen by the other. More
fatal, however, is the destruction of the measure. Both instances go
beyond all bounds of license. And though we may pass over the error in a
critic so eminent even as Tieck, we need feel no compunction at exposing
"earless on high" an Englishman who has pilloried so often and so
mercilessly others for the same offence.</p>

<p>While, however, L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span> has shown good cause against the adoption of
either of the above epithets, it does not appear to me that he has
succeeded in establishing a case in favour of <a id="the455"></a>the <span class="pagenum">[455]</span>word "pensive,"
which he proposes instead. In the first place, the passages your
correspondent quotes, show Angelo to be "strict," "firm," "precise," to
be "a man whose blood is very snow-broth," &amp;c., but certainly not
"pensive" in the common acceptation of the word. Secondly, he fails to
show that, if Shakspeare meant by "pensive" anything more than
<i>thoughtful</i> in the passages he cites, he meant anything so strong as
<i>religiously melancholy</i>, which would be the sense required to be of any
service to him as an epithet to the word "guards."</p>

<p>I will now, with your permission, call attention to what I consider an
oversight of enquirers into this subject. The conditions required, as
your correspondent well states, are "that the word adopted shall be (1)
suitable to the reputed character of Angelo; (2) an appropriate epithet
to the word 'guards;' (3) of the proper metre in both places; and (4)
similar in appearance to the word 'prenzie.'" Now, it does not appear to
have been considered that this similarity was to be sought in
manuscript, and not in print; or, if considered, that much more radical
errors arise from illegible manuscripts than the critics have allowed
for. In his "Introductory Notice," Mr. Knight says the word (<i>prenzie</i>)
"appears to have been inserted by the printer in despair of deciphering
the author's manuscript." Yet in his note to the text he has printed it,
together with three suggested emendations, as though he would call
attention to the comparative similarity in print. But if, as all have
hitherto assumed, the printer had read the first three or four letters
correctly, is it not most probable that the context, with the word
recurring within four lines, would have set him right? And his having
twice inserted a word having no apparent meaning, is it not as probable
that he was misled at the very beginning of the word by some careless
combination of letters presenting accidentally the same appearance in
the two instances? Having thus shown that the search for the true word
may have been too restricted, I will proceed to make a final suggestion.</p>

<p>When Claudio exclaims in surprise&mdash;</p>


    <div class="poem"><p>  "The (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) Angelo!"</p></div>


<p class="noindent">it is quite clear that the epithet which has to be supplied is one in
total contrast to the character just given of him by Isabella. What is
this character?</p>


     <div class="poem">
      <p class="i5"> "This <i>outward-sainted</i> deputy,&mdash;</p>
      <p>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</p>
      <p>Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew,</p>
      <p>As falcon doth the fowl,&mdash;<i>is yet a devil;</i></p>
      <p><i>His filth within being cast, he would appear</i></p>
      <p><i>A pond as deep as hell</i>."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To this it appears to me Claudio would naturally exclaim:</p>

     <div class="poem"><p> "The <i>saintly</i> Angelo!"</p></div>

<p class="noindent">and Isabella, as naturally following up the contrast, would continue&mdash;</p>


     <div class="poem">
 <p>"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</p>
 <p>The <i>damned'st body to invest and cover</i></p>
 <p>In <i>saintly guards</i>!"</p>
</div>


<p>My acquaintance with the handwriting of the age is very limited, but I
have no doubt there are possible scrawls in which <i>saintlie</i> might be
made to look like <i>prenzie</i>. If any one knows a better word, let him
propose it; only I beg leave to warn him against <i>pious</i>, which I have
already tried, and for various reasons rejected.</p>

    <p class="right">S<span class="smcap lowercase">AMUEL</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span>.</p>
<p class="left"> St. John's Wood, May 24. 1851.</p>


<p><i>"Prenzie" in "Measure for Measure."</i>&mdash;It must be gratifying to the
correspondents of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap
 lowercase">UERIES</span>" to know that their suggestions
receive attention and consideration, even though the result be
unfavourable to their views. I am therefore induced to express, as an
individual opinion, that the reading of the word "prenzie," as proposed
by L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span>, does not appear more satisfactory than those already suggested
in the various editions.</p>

<p>Of these, "precise" is by far the most consonant with the sense of the
context; while "pensive," almost exclusively restricted to the single
meaning, <i>contemplative</i>,&mdash;action of mind rather than strictness of
manner,&mdash;is scarcely applicable to the hypocritical safeguard denounced
by Isabella.</p>

<p>From the original word, too, the deviation of "precise" is less than
that of "pensive." Since the former substitutes <i>e</i> for <i>n</i>, and
transposes two letters in immediate proximity, while the latter
substitutes <i>v</i> for <i>r</i>, and transposes it from one end of the word to
the other.</p>

<p>But "precise" has the immeasurable advantage of repetition by Shakspeare
himself, in the same play, applied to the same person, and coupled with
the same word "guard," which is undoubtedly used in both instances in
the metaphorical sense of <i>defensive covering</i>, and not in that of
"countenance or demeanour," nor yet in that of "the formal trimmings of
scholastic robes:"</p>


 <div class="poem"> <p class="i5"> "Lord Angelo is precise;</p>
     <p>Stands at a guard with envy&mdash;</p>
     <p>O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell</p>
     <p>The damned'st body to invest and cover</p>
     <p>In precise guards."</p>
</div>


<p>Therefore, while I cannot quite join with Mr. Knight in understanding
"precise" as applicable to the formal cut of Angelo's garments, I
nevertheless agree with him, on other grounds, in awarding a decided
preference to the reading of the German critic.</p>

 <p class="right">A. E. B.</p>



<p><i>The Obsolete Word "Prenzie."</i>&mdash;I agree with your correspondent L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span>,
that the several emendations which have been suggested of the word
"prenzie," do not "answer all the necessary conditions."<span class="pagenum">[456]</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span>
<a id="says456"></a>says, "it is universally agreed that the word is a <a id="misprint5"></a>misprint."<a class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5">[5]</a> Now
misprinting may be traced to wrong letters being dropped in the boxes
into which compositors put the types, and which generally are found to
be neighbours (this is hardly intelligible but to the initiated).
However, <i>they</i> will at once see that a more unfortunate illustration
could hardly have been suggested. An error, made by the printer, often
passes "the reader" or corrector, because it is something, in appearance
and sound, like what should have been used. But in this word there is no
assimilation of either to any one of the words conjectured to have been
meant. Moreover, such a word would never have been <i>twice</i> used
erroneously in the same piece. May it not rather have been an adaptation
from the Norman <i>prisé</i>, or the Latin <i>prenso</i>, signifying <i>assumed</i>,
<i>seized</i>, &amp;c.? The <i>sound</i> comes much nearer, the <i>sense</i> would do. I
hardly like to venture a suggestion where so many eminent commentators
entertain other views; but it seems to me that it is a main excellence
of your periodical to encourage such suggestions; and if mine be not too
wild, your insertion of it will oblige</p>

<p>P.S. May I end this note by adopting a Query many years since put forth
by a highly valued and, alas! deceased friend and coadjutor in
antiquarian pursuits,&mdash;"What is the date of that edition of the Bible
which reads (Psalm cxix. 161.): <i>Printers</i> have persecuted me without a
cause?"</p>

<p><i>On a Passage in "Measure for Measure"</i> (Vol. iii., p. 401.).&mdash;One of
the very few admissible conjectural emendations on Shakspeare made by
the ingenious and gifted poet and critic Tieck, is that which Mr. Knight
adopted, and I cannot think your correspondent L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span> happy in proposing
to substitute "pensive."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that "guards" in the passage in question signifies
<i>facings</i>, <i>trimmings</i>, <i>ornaments</i>, and that it is used metaphorically
for <i>dress</i>, <i>habit</i>, <i>appearance</i>, and not for <i>countenance</i>,
<i>demeanour</i>.</p>

<p>The context clearly shows this:</p>


<div class="poem">
 <p> "<i>Claud.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>precise</i> Angelo?</p>
 <p>  "<i>Isab.</i> O, 'tis the cunning <i>livery</i> of hell,</p>
 <p> The damned'st body <i>to invest and cover</i></p>
 <p>      In <i>prècise guards</i>."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Isabella had before characterised Angelo&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">     <p> "This <i>outward-sainted</i> deputy is yet a devil:"</p></div>


<p class="noindent">and the Duke afterwards says:</p>

    <div class="poem">  <p>"Oh, what may man within him hide,</p>
      <p>Though angel <i>on the outward side</i>."</p></div>




<p>In <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (Act I. Sc. 1.), Benedick says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"The body of your discourse is sometimes <i>guarded</i> with
   fragments, and the <i>guards</i> are but slightly basted on neither."</p>


<p class="noindent">That the epithet "precise" is peculiarly applicable to the assumed
sanctity of Angelo, the poet has decided in Act I. Sc. 4., where the
Duke describes him thus:</p>


            <div class="poem">
 <p class="i9">"Lord Angelo is <i>precise</i>,</p>
      <p>Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses</p>
      <p>That his blood flows, or that appetite</p>
      <p>Is more to bread than stone. Hence we shall see,</p>
     <p> If power change purpose, what our <i>seemers</i> be."</p>
</div>

<p>"The 'pensive' Angelo" might be admissible, though not so appropriate as
"the precise;" but "pensive" is inapplicable to the word "guards," in
the sense which the poet everywhere attaches to it. In the second Scene
of this Act the Clown says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Craft being richer than innocency, stands for the <i>facing</i>."</p>

<p>Your correspondent may be assured that the word he would substitute was
never written or printed "penzive" in Shakspeare's time.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier's objection, that "precise" "sounds ill as regards the
metre, the accent falling on the wrong syllable," has no weight with me,
for it is doubtful whether the accent was not placed on the first
syllable of "prècise" by the poet and his cotemporaries; but were this
not the case, I should still very much prefer the reading proposed by
Tieck, and adopted by Mr. Knight, to any other that has been proposed,
and have <a id="Replies_to_Minor_Queries456"></a>little doubt that it is the true one.</p>

<span>(Vol. iii., p. 307.).</span></h4>


<p>&mdash;Let me thank
your correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span> for his information. In order to complete
the history of this inscription, it may be stated that though Gifford is
silent as to Jonson having any claim to it, yet, by admitting it into
his works (vol. viii. p. 337.), he concurs apparently with Whalley and
others, in assigning this "delicate epitaph," as Whalley terms it, to
Jonson, though it "hath never yet been printed with his works." Gifford
considers that Jonson did not "cancel," as it has been alleged, the six
lines, "Marble piles let no man raise," but that he possibly never saw
them. They certainly contradict the preceding ones; admitting that such
a character as the Countess <i>might</i> again appear. These last-mentioned
verses, Gifford adds, were copied from the poems of William Herbert Earl
of Pembroke, "a humble votary of the Muses." This nobleman, whose
amiable character is beautifully drawn by Clarendon, deeply venerated
his excellent mother; he, perhaps, could not feel satisfied in leaving
<a id="her457"></a>her <span class="pagenum">[457]</span>praises to be sung by another poet, and therefore added this
well-intended but feeble supplement.</p>

<p>&mdash;There are no orders of the Earl
Marshal, printed or manuscript, upon the subject of court costume&mdash;it is
not within his department. It is more likely that the Lord Chamberlain
has notices upon the subject. In all cases of court mourning, his
lordship specifies the dress, and notifies the changes, not always,
however, strictly adopted or comprehended.</p>

<h4><span><i>Ex Pede Herculem </i></span>

<p>&mdash;The origin of this proverb is
to be found, I think, in Plutarch, who is quoted by Aulus Gellius (i.&nbsp;1.)
 as saying in substance as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Pythagoras ingeniously calculated the great stature of Hercules,
   by comparing the length of various stadia in Greece. All these
   courses were nominally 600 feet in length, but Hercules was said
   to have measured out the stadium at Olympia with his own feet,
   while the others followed a standard of later days. The
   philosopher argued that by how much the Olympic course exceeded
   all others in length, by the same proportion did the foot of
   Hercules exceed that of men of a subsequent age; and again, by
   the same proportion must the stature of Hercules have been
   pre-eminent."</p>

<h4><span><i>The Day of the Accession of Richard III. </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 351.). </span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have
examined the original inrolment of the entry upon the Remembrance Roll
<i>ex parte Capitalis Rememoratoris Hiberniæ</i>, of the second year of
Richard III., with the <i>fac-simile</i> of that entry which appears in the
Irish Record Reports (1810-1815, plate 9.), and I find that the
<i>fac-simile</i> is correct. The accession of Richard III. is shown by the
entry upon the original record to have taken place on the twenty-<i>sixth</i>
day of June. This entry is, as I have stated, upon the roll of the
second year of Richard III., and not of the first year, as stated by the
said Record Reports, there being no Remembrance or Memoranda Roll of the
first year of that monarch to be found amongst the Exchequer Records of
Ireland. Upon this subject of Richard III.'s accession, I beg to
transmit to you the copy of a regal table which is entered in the Red
Book of the Exchequer, probably the most ancient, as well as the most
curious, record in Ireland. Judging by the character of the handwriting
of this <i>Tabula Regum</i>, I would come to the conclusion, that the entries
prior in date to that of Henry VIII.'s reign have been made during the
time of that monarch; or, in other words, that this table has probably
not been compiled at any time previous to the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[458]</span>I <a id="beg458"></a>beg to
withdraw my former suggestion as to "the crimson-circled star," which,
on reconsideration, appears to me manifestly erroneous.</p>

<p>If you can find space for a second suggestion, I think the question will
be cleared up by the following extract from the valuable work which I
cited before (the <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and
Mythology</i>, edited by Dr. W. Smith):</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Eos, <ins title="Greek: Éôs">Ἠώς</ins>, in Latin Aurora, the goddess of the morning
   red, who brings up the light of day from the east. At the close
   of night she ascended up to the heaven from the river Oceanus to
   announce the coming light of the sun to the gods as well as to
   men. In the Homeric poems, Eos not only announces the coming
   Helios (the sun), but accompanies him throughout the day, and her
   career is not complete till the evening: hence she is sometimes
   mentioned when one would have expected Helios (<i>Od.</i> v. 390. x.
   144.); and the tragic writers completely identify her with Hemera
   (the day), of whom, in later times the same mythes are related as
   of Eos."</p>

<p>As Aurora rises from the river Oceanus, he may be called her <i>father</i>,
and as she sinks into the same, he may be called her <i>grave</i>. The
expression then will mean neither more nor less than this, "We returned
home before the close of day."</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Tennyson had a line of Lycidas running in his mind:</p>


<div class="poem">      <p>"So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed."</p></div>


<p>Milton's day-star, however, I take to be the sun himself.</p>

<p>Another of your correspondents, I see, suggests a different
interpretation of the "crimson-circled star."</p>

<p>I hope I shall not be considered as taking too great a liberty if I
avail myself of the medium of your pages to request Mr. Tennyson (deus
ex machinâ) to descend and settle the question.</p>

close intimacy existed between the Queen and the Cardinal appears from
some allusions in contemporary letters (1685-1687). See M. Valéry's

where under "Bicham-well" he will find a Robert de Welle, lord of the
manor of Well Hall, an. 1326 (20 Edw. II.), which was held under the
<i>Earl of Clare</i>, the capital lord. He died circ. 9 Edw. III.</p>

<p>I have met also with a Roger de Welle, in an old roll undated, but about
the time of Hen. III., in which he is entered as holding a manor in
Wimbotsham, co. Norf.:</p>

<h4><span><i>Registry of Dissenters </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 370.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I beg to inform D. X.
that I have met with several instances of Dissenters' <i>burials</i> being
entered in parish registers, at a time when a more amicable feeling than
now exists prevailed between churchmen and themselves. In the register
of Warbleton, co. Sussex, in particular, there are several entries of
Quakers who were buried in their own cemetery in that parish, about 150
years since.</p>

     <p class="right">M. A. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span>.</p>
    <p class="left"> Lewes.</p>


<p><i>Registry of Ministerial Offices performed by Dissenters</i> (Vol. iii., p.
370.).&mdash;The note of D. X. has led me to examine the baptismal registers
of Ecclesfield parish, and I find on the parchment fly-leaf of the book
which contains the baptisms, that date from nearly the beginning of the
seventeenth century, the following heading&mdash;"Births of the children of
some Dissenters enter'd as given." Then comes a list of the names of
fourteen children, with the dates of their births; and, after several
miscellaneous entries of baptisms, I find,</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "January 3. 1750-1, Samuel, son of Thomas Sayles, said to be
   baptised at Sheffield by y<span class="topnum">e</span> Popish priest."</p>

<p class="noindent">The enrolment of births is, no doubt, quite improper. But the entering
of dissenting baptisms in the parish register (mentioned by D. X.) would
not, I think, be equally open to reprobation; inasmuch as the
registering has always been of baptisms <i>in the parish</i>, and not merely
<i>in the church</i>. Hence, if dissenting baptism be, as no doubt it is, a
valid title to burial by the clergyman, he might, not unreasonably, be
disposed to keep a list of such irregular administrations. That the law
has regarded them as irregular, is evident from the fact, that when in
1812 an act was passed "for the better regulating and preserving parish
and other registers of births, baptisms, marriages, and burials in
England," the 146th chap. of the same distinctly declares, that when a
baptism is performed by any other than the licensed minister of the
parish, the certificate of its performance must state that it was
"according to the rites of the United Church of England and Ireland." No
dissenting baptism, therefore, could now be registered by the clergyman.</p>

<p>In our burial register there is a slip of paper pinned, with this
inscription upon it:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "These are to certify that the remains of Ann, the wife of Thomas
   Ellis, was buried in the Methodist chapel-yard in Ecclesfield,
   the 5th day of November, 1826, aged (about) seventy-three."</p>


<p class="noindent">The poor woman chose to lie apart from her "rude forefathers;" and she
has continued to be the solitary tenant of the small enclosure round the
chapel. It seems, however, that her friends did the best they could
towards preserving her name on the list of those who sleep in the
consecrated cemetery.</p>

<h4><span><i>Poem on the Grave </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 372.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;A correspondent in your No.
of May 10th, signed A. D., wishes to be informed of the author of "The
Grave," a very beautiful poem; and he gives a portion of it thus:&mdash;
</p>

 <div class="poem">
 <p class="i7">    "<i>1st Voice.</i></p>
 <p>"How peaceful the grave, its quiet how deep,</p>
  <p> Its zephyrs breathe calmly, and soft is its sleep,</p>
 <p>  And flow'rets perfume it with ether."</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">  <p class="i7"> "<i>2nd Voice.</i></p>
 <p>   "How lonesome the grave, how deserted and drear,"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">(From what I remember of the poem, this stanza flows on thus):&mdash;</p>


    <div class="poem">  <p>"With the howls of the storm wind, the creaks of the bier,</p>
       <p> And the white bones all clattering together."</p>
</div>

<p>This poem extends to fifteen or twenty stanzas, and is exquisite in its
imagery, and peculiarly forcible (its author was a Russian, I think
Derzhavin), and in its original language might compare with the works of
the most polished poetry of advanced nations. It can be found translated
in Bowring's <i>Russian Anthology</i>, 12mo., published about 1824: where
also will be found some beautiful translations from <i>Lomonosoff</i>, "Or
Broken Nose," and other Russian poets. Derzhavin also has his grandest
poem on God, translated there: this poem is popular in no less than
thirty-six languages, and is familiar to the Chinese and Tartar nations,
and even as far as Southern India. I give the exordium, which is
noble:&mdash;</p>


     <div class="poem">
<p> "O Thou Eternal One, whose presence bright</p>
     <p> All space doth occupy, all motion guide;</p>
     <p> Unchanged through time's all-devastating flight;</p>
     <p> Thou only God! There is no God beside!"</p>
</div>

<p>And in a further portion of the poem, describing Heaven as the abode of
God, he speaks thus:</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> <span class="pagenum">[461]</span> "What <a id="shall461"></a>shall we call them? Piles of crystal light,</p>
    <p>  A glorious company of golden streams,&mdash;</p>
    <p>  Lamps of celestial ether burning bright,&mdash;</p>
    <p>  Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?"</p>
</div>

<p>I think I have quoted sufficient to direct A. D.'s attention to the
northern poets, who, though few in number, make up their deficiency in
quantity by the sterling and magnificent quality of their works.</p>

<h4><span><i>Round Robin </i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 353.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The "little predie round-robin,"
mentioned by Dr. Heylin, was no doubt a small pancake. (See Halliwell's
<i>Archaic and Provincial Dictionary</i>, under "Round Robin.")</p>

<p>Of the derivation of the petition also called a round robin, I find the
following account in the <i>Imperial Dictionary</i>:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "R<span class="smcap lowercase">OUND</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">OBIN</span>, n. [Fr. <i>rond</i> and <i>ruban</i>.] A written petition,
   memorial, or remonstrance signed by names in a ring or circle.
   The phrase is originally derived from a custom of the French
   officers, who, in signing a remonstrance to their superiors,
   wrote their names in a circular form so that it might be
   impossible to ascertain who had headed the list. It is now used
   to signify an act by which a certain number of individuals bind
   themselves to pursue a certain line of conduct."</p>


<p>The round robin sent to Dr. Johnson on the subject of his epitaph on
Goldsmith is well known. In speaking of it Boswell states that the
sailors make use of it "when they enter into a conspiracy, so as not to
let it be known who puts his name first or last to the paper."</p>

<h4><span><i>Derivation of the Word "Yankee"  </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 260.).</span>
</h4>



<p>&mdash;Your correspondent J. M., and M. Philarète Charles, are both incorrect in
saying that this derivation is not given in any English or American
work. In the <i>Poetical Works of John Trumbull, LL.D.</i>, published at
Hartford (U.S.), 1820, in two volumes, in the Appendix, appears the
following Note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  <i>"Yankies.</i>&mdash;The first settlers of New England were mostly
   emigrants from London and its vicinity, and exclusively styled
   themselves the English. The Indians, in attempting to utter the
   word <i>English</i>, with their broad guttural accent, gave it a sound
   which would be nearly represented in this way, <i>Yaunghees;</i> the
   letter <i>g</i> being pronounced hard, and approaching to the sound of
   <i>k</i> joined with a strong aspirate, like the Hebrew <i>cheth</i>, or
   the Greek <i>chi</i>, and the <i>l</i> suppressed, as almost impossible to
   be distinctly heard in that combination. The Dutch settlers on
   the river Hudson and the adjacent country, during their long
   contest concerning the right of territory, adopted the name, and
   applied it in contempt to the inhabitants of New England. The
   British of the lower class have since extended it to all the
   people of the United States. This seems the most probable origin
   of the term. The pretended Indian tribe of Yankoos does not
   appear to have ever had an existence; as little can we believe in
   an etymological derivation of the word from ancient Scythia or
   Siberia, or that it was ever the name of a horde of savages in
   any part of the world."</p>


<p>I some time ago thought of sending you a copy of this "Note," but had
forgotten it, until recalled to my memory by reading J. M.'s extract.</p>

      <p class="left"> King William's College, Isle of Man.</p>



<p><i>Yankee&mdash;Yankee-doodle</i> (Vol. iii., p. 260.).&mdash;In a curious book on the
Round Towers of Ireland (I forget the title), the origin of the term
Yankee-doodle was traced to the Persian phrase, "Yanki dooniah," or
"Inhabitants of the New World." Layard, in his book on <i>Nineveh and its
Remains</i>, also mentions "Yanghi-dunia" as the Persian name of America.</p>


     <p class="right">B<span class="smcap lowercase">ENBOW</span>.</p>
       <p class="left">Birmingham.</p>


<p><i>Yankee.</i>&mdash;The following lines from a poem, written in England by the
Rev. James Cook Richmond, of Providence, Rhode Island, and dated Sept.
7, 1848, gives the derivation of this word:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p>"At Yankees, John, beware a laugh,</p>
        <p class="i3">Against yourself you joke:</p>
    <p>For <i>Yenghees</i> 'English' is, but half</p>
        <p class="i3">By Indian natives spoke."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Philarète Charles then has too hastily concluded that this etymology
is not given in "aucun ouvrage américain ou anglais," and has supplied
us with a surprising coincidence, since he appears to have fairly
translated the first two lines, viz.: "Les Anglais, quand ils se moquent
des <i>Yankies</i>, se moquent d'eux-mêmes."</p>

<p> "Friday cut hair, Sunday cut horn,</p>

<p>The meaning given to it was, that cutting horn was a kind of <i>work</i>, and
therefore a breach of the Sabbath and that cutting hair on the Friday
was, like a hundred other things, thought unlucky on a Friday, from some
obscure reference to the great sacrifice of <i>Good Friday</i>. Sir Thomas
Browne shows that this was perhaps the continuation of ancient
superstition; and it is peculiarly remarkable that amongst the Romans
the <i>Dies Veneris</i> (Friday) should have been thought unlucky for
<i>hair-cutting</i>. His reference to the crime of Manasses, "of observing
times," enters into no detail, and the text is evidently a general
condemnation of superstitious observances. I may as well here remark
that Browne's reference to Manasses, 1 Chron. xxxv., in my edition
(1686), is erroneous: it should be 2 Chron. xxxiii. 6.</p>

is a native tree. And the Sycamore was introduced into England long
before the Lombardy, and I think before any of the Poplar tribe.</p>

<p>I have seen the Mistletoe propagated by seed inserted, with an upward
cut of a knife, under the bark of an apple-tree.</p>

<p>On the Oak I have never seen the Mistletoe. The late Mr. Loudon, when

<h4><span><i>T. Gilbert on Clandestine Marriages </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 167.).</span>
</h4>



<p>&mdash;Thomas Gilbert, the author of the MS. treatise mentioned by your correspondent,
was the son of William Gilbert, of Priss, in Shropshire. He was born in
1613, and at the age of sixteen entered the University of Oxford. He
took the degree of M.A. in 1638, and was afterwards appointed minister
of Upper Winchington, in Buckinghamshire. He joined the Puritan party at
the beginning of the rebellion, and was made vicar of St. Lawrence,
Reading. Wood says that he turned Independent, "was actually created
Bachelor of Divinity in the time of the Parliamentarian visitation," and
was preferred to the rich rectory of Edgmond, in his native county of
Shropshire. Being very active against the Royalists, he was commonly
called the "Bishop of Shropshire." After the Restoration he was, of
course, ejected, when he retired to Oxford, and lived obscurely many
years, with his wife, in the parish of St. Ebbs. He lived latterly upon
charity, and died in the extreme of poverty, in the year 1694. For more
minute particulars of the life of this person, and a catalogue of his
writings, see Wood's <i>Athenæ Oxon.</i>, edit. Bliss, vol. iv. p. 406.

<h4><span><i>Pope Joan </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 265.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;If the man who believes in this fable
can be found in England, he will meet with the demonstration of its
falsehood in the cotemporary chronicles of Galindo, Bishop of Troyes,
otherwise called by his assumed name of religion, Prudentius Trecensis,
or Trecassensis. (See <i>Monumenta Germaniæ Historica</i>, Hanover, 1826,
vol. i. p. 449.) It there appears clearly that no Pope John VIII.
succeeded Leo IV., or preceded Benedict III. Prudentius survived them
<i>both</i> by three years. His words are "Mense Augusto Leo apostolicæ sedis
antistes defunctus est, eique Benedictus successit. Eodem mense duæ
stellæ majoris et minoris quantitatis visæ sunt," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It seems to me that a just blindness fell upon men so evil-minded as to
desire the falsification of chronology and history for polemical ends,
that they should have utterly missed the moral principle by which they
would be thought animated. No prelate ordaining a young person, unknown
to himself, save by academical reputation, could <i>know</i> that person's
sex. The want of beard is no criterion; nor is the female lip in all
instances very smooth. But if it were true that a person eminently
distinguished by studies, and bringing from Athens a high reputation for
merit, could upon those grounds alone obtain the suffrages of the Roman
chapter, more honour would be conferred upon it than that chapter, or
other dispensers of patronage, have usually merited. Instead of being
unknown, the candidates in the days of Benedict III. were, if anything,
<i>too well known</i>; for the jobbery and faction, of which this fable would
indicate the entire, and almost unnatural, absence, were sufficiently at
work.</p>

furnish you with materials for a corner, to be entitled, "The Prophecy

criticism abounds, taken from the Reviews of twenty years or more
preceding the current year. Thus, in this year of 1851, the corner
should be open to any prophecy uttered in or before 1831, and palpably
either fulfilled or falsified. In a little while, when the subject
begins to cool, the admission should be restricted to prophecy of
precisely twenty years of previous date. Such a corner would be useful
warning to critics, and useful knowledge to their readers.</p>

<h4><span><i>Sabbatical and Jubilee Years of the Jews  </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 373.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;You must find it difficult to know what to do when a correspondent obtains
admission into your columns who absolutely requires to be sent back to
elementary books. On the one hand, care must be taken not to discourage
communication: on the other hand, there is a species of communication
which must be gently discouraged. Nothing has ever appeared in your
columns which makes this remark more necessary than the communication
headed as above, and signed by the venerable name of H<span class="smcap lowercase">IPPARCHUS</span>. Your
well meaning, but hitherto not sufficiently instructed, correspondent,
seems to imagine either that the Jewish year was wholly lunar, or that a
solar year may consist of a fixed number of (wrong) lunar months. Now,
the lunar month is <i>not</i> 29 days, but 29-&frac12; days; and the Jews, whom he
calls ignorant of astronomy (which they were, compared with Hipparchus
of Rhodes), met this, as most know, by using months of 29 days and of 30
days in equal numbers. And surely every one must know that the Jewish
year was regulated, as to its commencement, by the sun and the equinox.
The year opened just before the Passover, which required a supply of
lamb. Unless lamb had been obtainable all the solar year round, a
regular lunar year (such as the Mahometans have) would have made a due
observance of the Passover impossible. I hope your correspondent can
bear to be told, good-humouredly, that it passes all reasonable
permission that he should speculate on chronological questions as yet.</p>

<h4><span><i>Luncheon </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 369.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I cannot help doubting this
derivation; and I suspect that the true meaning of the word is, a piece,
or slice (or <i>vulgo</i>, a "hunch") of bread. When people who dined early,
and breakfasted comparatively late, wanted any intermediate refreshment,
"a luncheon" (or, as we should now say, "just a crust of bread") was
sufficient. The Query brought to my mind some verses of the younger
Beattie, which were published with his father's <i>Minstrel</i>, &amp;c., in
which he uses the word "luncheon" for the piece of bread placed beside
the plate at dinner. I have no doubt of the fact, though I cannot
recollect the lines, or find the book. But after searching in vain for
it, I took down Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>; and under the word I found this
couplet by Gay, which is perhaps a better authority:</p>

<h4><span><i>Prophecy respecting the Discovery of America </i></span>

<div class="poem">
     <p>"Venient annis secula seris,</p>
     <p>Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum</p>
     <p>Laxet, et ingens pateat tellus,</p>
     <p>Tethysque novos detegat orbes;</p>
     <p>Nec sit terris ultima Thule."</p>
            <p class="author"><i>Medea</i>, Act II., ad finem, v. 375.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and he says that some commentator describes these lines as "a
vaticination of the Spanish discovery of America." I believe, however,
that Lord Bacon may claim the merit of having been the first to notice
this vaticination. In his essay "Of Prophecies" he says:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "Seneca, the tragedian, hath these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
                  <p class="i9"> 'Venient annis</p>

<h4><span><i>Shakspeare's Designation of Cleopatra </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 273.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;I fully
agree with your correspondent S. W. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> that an imperfect
acquaintance with our older language has been the weak point of the
commentators, but at the same time I think they have been equally guilty
of an imperfect acquaintance with the history and character of
Cleopatra, and one at least of a careless reading of the text; otherwise
it appears incomprehensible how, on the one hand, the words of the great
poet could have been so distorted; on the other hand, how Scarus could
be thought to allude, by the word "ribald," to Antony. On reference to
Rider's <i>Dictionary</i>, published in 1589, the very year in which Malone
places Shakspeare's first play, <i>First Part of Henry VI.</i>, may be found
the word <i>Ribaud</i>, leno, a bawd, a pander; <i>Ribaudrie</i>, lascivia,
obsc&oelig;nitas, impudicitia, Venus; and <i>Ribaudrous</i>, obsc&oelig;nus,
impudicus, impurus.</p>

<p><i>Hagge</i>, doubtless the word of Shakspeare, also may be found in Rider,
answering to the Latin <i>lamia</i>, <i>fascinatrix</i>, <i>oculo maligna mulier</i>.</p>

<p>Arguing from the above, what more appropriate term than "ribaudred
hagge" could be applied to Cleopatra, a queen celebrated for her beauty,
her cunning, her debauchery, nay, even adultery. The sister and wife of
Ptolemy Dionysius, she admitted Cæsar to her embraces, and by him had a
son called Cæsarion, and afterwards became enamoured of Antony, who,
forgetful of his connexion with Octavia, the sister of Cæsar, publicly
married her; thus causing the rupture between him and Cæsar, who met in
a naval engagement off Actium, where Cleopatra, "when 'vantage like a
pair of twins appeared," by flying with sixty sail, ruined the interest
of Antony, and he was defeated; and so were called forth the imprecatory
words of Scarus.</p>

<p>&mdash;The origin of the word <i>hellequin</i>,
unknown to M. Paul Paris, is to be sought in Scandinavia, especially
Norway, whence so many swarms of fierce Pagan settlers rushed into
Normandy and other parts of France. The <i>helle-quinna</i> or <i>hell-quean</i>
was the famous <i>hela</i> or <i>hel</i>, the <i>death-goddess</i> (whence our word
<i>hell</i>, the <i>death-realm</i>, as still used in the Creed, &amp;c.), so well
known also to our own West Scandinavian (commonly called Anglo-Saxon)
forefathers. The Wild Hunt of the Helle-quinna (the Death-quean and her
Meynie) was therefore soon easily synonymous with that of <i>La Mort</i>,
and, as M. Paris has well observed, naturally led to the grotesque
mummeries of <i>notre famille d'Arlequin</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Quarles, in his <i>Emblems</i>,

cross is the christ-cross of all our happiness," <i>i. e.</i> the alphabet,
the beginning, perhaps the alpha and omega. Grose, in his <i>Olio</i>, p.
195., 1796, relates the following story:
</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "An Irishman explaining the reason why the Alphabet is called the
   Criss-cross-Rowe, said it was because Christ's cross was
   <i>prefixed</i> at the beginning and end of it."</p>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of "Waste-book"</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., pp. 118. 195. 251. 307.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The

evidently unacquainted with the subject on which they write; with the
exception, however, of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span>, whose quotation from the
<i>Merchant's Mirrour</i> confirms what I am about to say. To the clerk in a

</div>

<p class="noindent">the waste-book may indeed be a weary waste; but he does not call it so
for that reason, any more than he gives poetical names to the day-book
or ledger. In short, we must not go to the merchant's counting-house at
all to discover its meaning; or, if we do, "the book-keeper and cashier"
who makes the Query may refer us to one of the elders, or head of the
firm, who, if he be not too proud to own it, may just recollect that his
progenitors or predecessors in the <i>chandler's shop</i> made their rough
entries in a book which was literally waste. For origins we must look to
the lowest forms or types existing. The merchant's system of
book-keeping was not invented perfect; and we may see its various stages
in the different gradations of trade at the present day. In many
respectable shops, in the country especially, the waste-book is formed
by a quire or two of the commonest paper used in the particular trade,
that will bear pen and ink, sown together. An advance upon this is the
waste-book as a distinct book, bound and ruled, of which the day-book or
journal is merely a fair copy; and this being made, the former is held
of no account. The importance, however, of reference to original entries
has no doubt led to the preservation of the "Waste-book" in regular
book-keeping, and a modification of its character.</p>

<h4><span><i>Francis Moore</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., pp. 263. 381.).</span>
</h4>



<p>&mdash;Francis Moore, physician,
was one of the many quack doctors who duped the credulous at the latter
period of the seventeenth century; he practised in Westminster: in all
probability then, as in our own time, the publication of the almanac was
to act as an advertisement of his healing powers, &amp;c. Cookson, Salmon,
Gadbury, Andrewes, Tanner, Coley, Partridge, &amp;c. &amp;c., were all his
predecessors, and were students in physic and astrology. Moore's
<i>Almanac</i> appears to be a perfect copy of Tanner's, which was first
published in 1656, forty-two years prior to the appearance of Moore's.
The portrait in Knight's <i>London</i> is certainly imaginary. There is a
genuine and very characteristic portrait, <i>now of considerable rarity</i>,
representing him as a fat-faced man in a wig and large neck-cloth,
inscribed "Francis Moore, born in Bridgnorth, in the county of Salop,
the 29th of January, 1656/7.&mdash;J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> D<span class="smcap lowercase">RAPENTIER</span>, delin.

<p>I may mention it as a curious fact, that the portraits of these quack
doctors, when in a good state, are frequently of great rarity. I possess
one which was in the Stow collection, being a fine impression of the
following print by Drapentier, for which the sum of five guineas had
been paid:</p>

J. M., who dates his dedication to his dear sister A. M., "from the
Englishe Charter House in Bridges (<i>sic</i>), the vigil of the Assumption

and had, previously to her brother's departure for Bruges, requested him
to send her a translation of the <i>Rosary</i>, which having obtained, his
cousin and friend J. Noel procured it to be printed. J. M. willingly
confessing "for that I know there be many good women in Englande that
honour Our Lady, but good bookes to stirre vp deuotion in them are

<h4><span><i>Bunyan and the Visions of Heaven and Hell  </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 89.).</span>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
O<span class="smcap lowercase">FFOR</span> has very satisfactorily shown that Bunyan could not, from its
grandiloquent style, have been the author of the <i>Visions of Heaven and
Hell</i>, attributed to him in an edition of that work published in the
reign of George I., entitled, <i>The Visions of John Bunyan, being his
last Remains</i>.</p>

<p>This title must have been a surreptitious one, for, since M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. O<span class="smcap lowercase">FFOR</span> made
the above communication, I have obtained a copy of this scarce book
published <i>in the previous reign</i>, under its legitimate title (as in the
Sunderland copy of 1771, mentioned at p. 70. <i>supra</i>), and said to be
"By G. L. <ins title="[Greek: philanthrôpo.]"> φιλανθρωπο</ins> London, printed for <i>John Gwillim</i>,
against <i>Crossby Square</i> in Bishopsgate-street, 1711."</p>

<p>In his address "To the Reader" (also signed G. L.), the author even
makes the following direct allusion to Bunyan's allegory:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "And since the <i>Way</i> to Heaven has been so taking under the
   similitude of a <i>dream</i>, why should not the <i>Journey's End</i> be as
   acceptable under the similitude of a <i>vision</i>? Nay, why should
   it not be more acceptable, since the end is preferable to the
   <i>means</i>, and <i>Heaven</i> to the <i>Way</i> that brings us thither? <i>The
   Pilgrim</i> met with many difficulties; but here they are all over.
   All storms and tempests here are hush'd in silence and serenity."</p>


<p>It will therefore, I think, be admitted that the name of Bunyan ought no
longer to be associated with this work, and that all inferences drawn
from the fallacy of his having been the author of it should henceforth
be disregarded.</p>

<p>It would, however, be desirable, if possible, to ascertain who G. L.
really was, and how the spurious title-page came to be affixed by
"Edward Midwinter, at the Looking-Glass upon London Bridge," to his
edition of this allegory?</p>

<h4><span><i>Mazer Wood </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., pp. 239. 288.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;Your Querist asks, "Has the
word Mazer any signification in itself?" It signifies <i>Maple</i>, being a
corruptions of the Welsh word <i>Masarn</i>&mdash;the maple-tree. Probably,
therefore, the use of the wood of the maple for bowls and drinking-cups
prevailed in this country many centuries before the times of Spenser and
Chaucer, in whose works they are mentioned. In Devonshire the black
cherry-tree, which grows to a large size in that county, is called the
mazer-tree. From this circumstance I conjecture that this wood has been
used there in former times for bowls and drinking-cups as a substitute
for maple. That the original word, <i>mazer</i>, should have been retained,
is not to be wondered at. It is known that when the mazer bowl was made
of silver, the old name was retained. The name of the maple-tree, in the
Irish language, is <i>crann-mhalpais</i>; therefore the name of the Irish
wooden drinking-cup <i>maedher</i> cannot be derived from it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Any of your readers who are

production, by Dr. Pereira. It is used as a medicine by the Chinese, by
whom it is called the "summer-plant-winter-worm," and who attribute to
it great cordial and restorative powers. The mode of employing it is
curious. A duck is stuffed with five drachms of the insect fungus, and
roasted by a slow fire; when done, the stuffing is taken out, the virtue
of which has passed into the duck, which is to be eaten twice a day for
eight or ten days. In the same work, vol. iv. p. 204., Dr. Pereira gives
a further account of the moth on whose larva the fungus grows.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Coptic Language</i></span>
<span> (Vol. ii., pp. 376. 499.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The reply of H<span class="smcap lowercase">ERMAPION</span>
to the questions put by J. E. is scarcely satisfactory. I will endeavour
to answer then more directly. The Coptic language is not an inflected
one; and it has very few affixes. There are many prefixes to its nouns
and verbs, which before the former are articles or demonstrative
pronouns. Between these prefixes and the noun or verb, pronominal
infixes are introduced, by which possession is denoted in the case of a
noun, and the subject in that of a verb. Thus, <i>ran</i> is "a name;"
<i>pi-ran</i>, "the name;" <i>pe-v-ran</i>, "his name;" <i>i</i>, is the verbal root,
"come;" <i>a</i>, the prefix of the past tense; and <i>a-v-i</i>, "he came." Some
nouns take affixes, as <i>jo-v</i>, "his head." Pronominal affixes are also
joined to verbs to express their objects, and to prepositions. In the
old Egyptian language, from which the Coptic is derived, there were more
affixes. I am not aware that infixes have been met with in inscriptions
prior to the eighteenth dynasty; and those which are in use are the same
as the affixes which annexed to nouns denote possession, and to verbs
the subject. The old Egyptian affixes which denoted the object of the
verb, are in general different. <i>En-v-tu</i> would be "he bringeth thee;"
and <i>en-ka-su</i>, "thou bringest him." In Coptic, the former would be
<i>e-o-en-k;</i> the latter, <i>e-k-en-v</i>. Probably the Coptic prefixes were
originally auxiliary verbs, or prepositions. The old Egyptian affixes
greatly resemble the Hebrew ones, especially if <i>s</i> be substituted for
the Hebrew <i>h</i>; and it is very remarkable that the Assyrio-Babylonian
affixes differ from the Hebrew principally in this same respect. In like
manner, the causative conjugation is formed from the simple one by
prefixing <i>h</i> in Hebrew, but by prefixing <i>s</i> in both Assyrio-Babylonian
and Egyptian. No doubt can then exist as to the old Egyptian language
being Semitic; but the opposition between the Semitic languages and the
Indo-European ones is by no means so great as was formerly supposed.
Relations between them are now clearly to be traced, which prove that
they had a common origin, and that at no distant period.</p>

protuberance, not, I believe, found in our ordinary English pigs, but
which forms a remarkable characteristic of the African wild boar. In the
African species it is large; in the Chinese, if it be rightly so called,
it is about half the length of a forefinger, and a quarter of an inch in
height. I have no doubt that Mr. Ramsden, of Carlton Hall, Notts, would
furnish additional information concerning these pigs, should it be
required; and the publication of it would perhaps be interesting to
many.

<h4><span><i>Meaning of Mosaic</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 389.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The breast-plate of the
Jewish High Priest, as commanded by <i>Moses</i>, was to be four square, and
that divided into twelve squares, to designate the twelve tribes of
Israel: from this circumstance, the word <i>Mosaic</i> was derived as a term
of Art, being a series or congregate of small squares of different
coloured stones, applicable to the formation of any tesselated figure.</p>

<p><i>Mosaic</i>.&mdash;This word would appear to be derived from the Greek,
<ins title="[Greek:
mousa ek myô,]">μοῦσα ἐκ μύω,</ins> <i>to close by pressure</i>; Latin, <i>musa</i> vel <i>musivum</i>, that
is, "opus eximia compositione tessellatum," a piece of <i>tesselated</i> or
<i>chequered</i> work of superior manufacture, in regard to the manner in
which the small stones or pieces of wood are <i>closed</i> or <i>joined</i>
together. </p>

<h4><span><i>The Tradescants </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii, pp. 119. 286. 353. 391.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In common with
several of your correspondents, I have for some time past taken great
interest in the Tradescants, and have read with much pleasure the
letters of D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT</span>, M<span
 class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, and M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
 P<span class="smcap lowercase">INKERTON</span>.</p>

<p>I have hitherto been unsuccessful in discovering any further particulars
of the family of the Tradescants; but a few days since, in looking into
a copy of Dr. Ducarel's tract on the subject, preserved among the books
in the Ashmolean Museum, I found the following note in pencil, not very
legibly written in the margin of the tract, where Dr. Ducarel says he
has not been able to find any account in the Lambeth Register of the
death of the elder Tradescant. "Consult (with certainty of finding
information concerning the Tradescants) the Registers of &mdash;&mdash;apham,
Kent." Since this note was written, the tract has been bound and the
commencement of several words cut off. Amongst them is the name of the
place of which the registers are to be consulted. I imagine it to be
<i>Meapham</i> (<i>apham</i> is all that can be read).</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your correspondents may have an opportunity of
consulting the registers of Meapham, and should any information
respecting the Tradescants be found there, the marginal note will not
have been without its use.</p>

<p>I am looking forward with great interest to the information which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
P<span class="smcap lowercase">INKERTON</span> promises us on the subject; and should this letter be the
means of directing him to a new source of information, it will be a
matter of great satisfaction to me.</p>

<h4><span><i>St. John's Bridge Fair </i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., pp. 88. 287. 341.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Having received the last polish at Peterborough Grammar School in 1840, and
from a three years' residence off and on, I am enabled to speak to the
fact of there being two fairs held at Peterborough.</p>

<p>One, commonly called St. John's Fair, is usually held on the 18th July;
but whether it is also called <i>St. John's Bridge Fair</i> I am unable to
say, as this fair was always held in our holidays, although it might be
so termed.</p>

<p>The other, commonly called "Bridge Fair," is held in the early part of
October, and is so called from its proximity to the bridge. The piece in
which the fairs are held is called the Bridge Close. Indeed I believe
both these fairs were held in the same piece, or at least close by each
other, although held at different times.</p>

<p>I hope this may assist, but whether it is the same spoken of at p. 88. I
cannot say.</p>

<h4><span><i>A Tye  </i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 263.)</span>
</h4>

<p class="noindent">is described by your correspondent as a
place where three roads meet. Perhaps he means a place where one road
divides into <i>two</i>. The nucleus of old English towns will be almost
always found to consist of such a fork of one road into two, requiring
three principal gates or entrances, and distinguishing the plans of
towns from those of cities, in which four roads meet, forming the
Carfoix, and requiring four principal gates. Is there any affinity of
the words <i>two</i>, <i>tye</i>, and <i>town</i>? The parallel case of the junction of
two rivers into one affects the names of places situated there, as
<i>Tiverton</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;In<span class="pagenum">[470]</span>
 reference <a id="to470"></a>to
the subject of the name "Vineyard" being still applied to certain places
in England, it may be curious to note that the little village of
<i>F</i>ingest, on the borders of Oxon and Bucks, was formerly called
<i>V</i>ingest; and a farm in the same parish, now known as the <i>F</i>ineing,
appears on an old tablet in the church as "the Vineing." I should add
that the country around is full of steep sunny slopes; and would be, in
a warmer climate admirably adapted for vines.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>It having occurred to Mr. Hudson Turner that our national records might
be made available to illustrate the history of architecture in England,
he has for the last sixteen years "made a brief in his note-book" of
every fact bearing on the subject which came under his notice in the
course of his daily reference to those documents for professional
objects and he has now given to the world some portions of the valuable
materials thus collected in a handsome volume published by Mr. Parker,
of Oxford, under the title of <i>Some Account of Domestic Architecture in
England, from the Conquest to the end of the Thirteenth Century, with
numerous illustrations of existing Remains from original Drawings</i>. It
is not, of course, within our limits to trace even briefly the results
of Mr. Turner's labours, or to point out how much light he has thrown
upon a branch of architectural study which, although involved in great
obscurity, has hitherto received but little attention. But we may remark
that its perusal shows, that to an intimate acquaintance with the
invaluable materials for elucidating every department of historical or
antiquarian knowledge to be found in our records, Mr. Turner adds
considerable tact in the employment of his materials, and has
endeavoured therefore, and very successfully, to make his history of
domestic architecture an important contribution towards that of our
social progress. The consequence is, that while, thanks to the valuable
assistance of Mr. Parker, the architectural student will find in this
handsomely illustrated volume much to instruct and delight him, it may
be read with interest by those who are altogether indifferent to the
subject to which it is more immediately devoted.</p>

<p>Our able and indefatigable contributor, Dr. Rimbault, has put forth for
the especial delight of those who, like Mopsa, "love a ballad in print,"
<i>A Little Book of Songs and Ballads gathered from Ancient Musick Books
MS. and Printed</i>. The various pieces contained in it have been selected
from many volumes of considerable rarity, and are illustrated by
numerous notes, which are characterised by Dr. Rimbault's accustomed
ability and industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Delf has received from America some copies of an octavo volume
bearing the title of <i>A Library Manual, containing a Catalogue Raisonnée
of upwards of Twelve Thousand of the most important Works in every
Department of Knowledge</i>. Although very imperfectly executed (and the
circumstances under which we are informed it was executed may perhaps be
pleaded as some excuse for such imperfections), it is still a book which
might with advantage be placed on the shelves of newly formed literary
societies, as a means of informing the members as to the principal works
existing in the various departments of learning. The idea upon which the
book is founded is so good, and its object one of such obvious utility,
that we have little doubt but it will ere long be much more successfully
carried out.</p>

<p class="center">On July 1st will be published, Part I., price 4s.,</p>

<p class="center">To be completed in Four Monthly Parts, to form one Handsome Volume,
crown 8vo.</p>


<p>This beautiful and unique edition of Shakspeare will be produced
   under the immediate and auspicious encouragement of the Most
   Noble the Marquis of Lansdowne.</p>

<p> It is anticipated that its triumph as a Specimen of the Art of
   Printing will only be exceeded by the facility and clearness
   which the new arrangement of the text will afford in reading the
   works of "the mightiest of intellectual painters." Its
   portability will render it as available for travelling, as its
   beauty will render it an ornament to the drawing-room.</p>

   <p>Every care has been taken to render the text the most perfect yet
   produced. The various folios and older editions, together with
   the modern ones, of Johnson, Stevens, Malone, Boswell, Knight,
   and Collier (also Dyce's Remarks on the two latter), have been
   carefully compared and numerous errors corrected.</p>

  <p> The Portrait, after Droeshout, will be engraved by H. R<span class="smcap lowercase">OBINSON</span> in
   his first style.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
